## Abstract

The deployment of police officers for bandobast duty is crucial for maintaining law and order during public events or emergencies. However, ensuring that police officers remain at their assigned posts can be challenging, especially in situations where there is no clear visual checkpoints or supervision.

In this context, the use of Near Field Communication (NFC) technology provides a potential solution to remotely track police officers deployed to bandobast duty. By outfitting police officers with NFC-enabled tags or other forms of wearable technology, their location can be easily tracked and monitored through an NFC reader system. This system can be set up at various checkpoints or locations where police officers are deployed, allowing for real-time monitoring of their movements.

This project aims to build on the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing an NFC-based system for tracking police officers during bandobast duty. It discusses the technical considerations for implementing such a system, including the design of the NFC tags and readers, data management, and privacy concerns. In addition to this, it examines the potential benefits of such a system, including increased accountability and transparency, improved resource allocation, and enhanced public safety.

Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of using NFC technology for remote tracking of police officers deployed for bandobast duty, providing a viable solution for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of law enforcementÂ operations.
